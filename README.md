# T-Display-S3-Time-Date-Weather
This code obtains WX from OWM and shows it in several ways, current and forecasted.

You will need to obtain a free API ID from the OpenWeatherMap site and put it in this code. 
There are other customiations to be made in the Defines_and_Docs tab, right at the top.

This is still a work-in-progress but is working as coded.  Other functions, features or 
improvements may be made in the future until I am totally happy with it.  

Enjoy,
Mike
